1. **What was the bug?**

    - The value of `num1` and `num2` are string types and `result` ends up being the concatenation of `"1"` and `"2"` instead of the sum of the numbers 1 and 2.

2. **How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png**

    - I would change the values of `num1` and `num2` to numbeers with the function `Number()`.
